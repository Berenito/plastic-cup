# plastic-cup

Setup:
* Install the Python interpreter
* Install packages specified in `requirements.txt` to the Python interpreter (`pip install requirements.txt`)
* Create a folder to store the documents (`PATH_DOCUMENTS`)
* Create a `team_names.txt` file in `PATH_DOCUMENTS` folder containing the list of teams (one per row)

New round can be generated by running `python generate_next_round.py --path <PATH_DOCUMENTS> --round <ROUND>`
* For round 1, only the `games_round_1.csv` file will be generated with empty scores
* To generate the next rounds, complete first the results of the previous-round games
* For rounds 2-8 files `games_round_{ROUND}.csv` and `summary_round_{ROUND-1}.csv` will be generated
* For round 9, only the summary of round 8 will be generated
* From round 6 on, 8 playoff teams are excluded from the rating system

Ratings are calculated as the linear regression of the score differences capped at 15.

Opponents are generated according to the minimum-cost pairing of the squares of rating differences.

For odd number of teams, `pickup` team will be assigned to the left-out team (picked randomly).

Errors should be raised if you are trying to do something that you should not (CSVs missing, round already calculated, missing scores, etc.), but rather double-check everything.

You can theoretically rewrite the games CSV file manually if you dislike something too much.
